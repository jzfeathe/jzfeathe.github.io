Now that I have completed this project, I think I have a better understanding of how to perform an EDA. I explored the data for a while and 
thought about what I wanted to focus on for a few hours before finally deciding on the response variable. If I were to start this project
again from the beginning, I would likely read the data in and immediately do a `summary()` table to get the mean and quartiles of the 
response variable. It's difficult to think of much else I would do differently since the project is still very fresh and recent to me and I'm
happy with what I've produced.  

I think the most difficult aspect of the project was coming to terms with my horrible R^2 values for both models. I assumed it should have been
higher like the other examples we saw in the lecture notes or homework, so I either greatly messed things up or this was a teaching lesson. I'm
hoping it is the latter which also brings me to my big take-away fromo this project: Not all data will produce good results and sometimes the 
variables we have access to will not explain the response variable well.
