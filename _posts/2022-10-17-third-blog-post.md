I would say I didn't really have much of a strategy for EDA since the most recent project was the first time I have performed one. That said, the articles provided
a lot of good tips that I plan on using for future EDA. The [NIST article](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section1/eda11.htm) focuses on making use of 
plots to view the data in an unassuming way to allow it a chance to reveal truths to us; this is the ultimate goal of EDA. In particular, it says to plot raw data 
using histograms, probability plots, and block plots. Next, you should plot simple statistics such as mean plots, standard deviation plots, box plots, and main 
effects plots. These are all very good ideas that I will incorporate into future EDA, but I really enjoyed (and saved) the 
[shopify article](https://shopify.engineering/conducting-exploratory-data-analysis) because of the straightforward 5-step approach to performing EDA. I plan on 
closely following this approach for future tasks. The steps are:  
1. Check for missing data
2. Provide basic descriptions of your sample and features
3. Identify the shape of your data
4. Identify significant correlations
5. Spot outliers in the dataset  

After completing these steps, the EDA is almost complete, but you still have to know where to go next with your results. A simple step would be to present a summary
of your EDA findings to leadership. But as the shopify article mentions, you need to find out what your team is interested in to know what to do next. The EDA is
simply a nice way of organizing information about the data so a smooth transition can be made when you know what it is you're eventually after. EDA isn't always 
necessary, but I'd be willing to wager it would save a lot of time and headache overall.
