Data scientists and statisticians have similar, yet distinct roles. The articles seemed to split the fields in terms of applied vs.
academic; I disagree. It's true that data science requires a strong statistical foundation in conjunction with programming and
product knowledge in order to create tangible marketability, but traditional statisticians are not all sitting around in university
classrooms, sipping cups of java, while pondering their next theory to be published. Traditional statisticians perform analyses
for businesses that aren't focused on internet data collection, as well as hypothesis tests for clinical trials in the medical field.
It should seem obvious that I'm partial to the role of traditional statistician. Though I certainly agree that data science is a hot
topic, it may be a bit too fast-paced for someone that is not young and ambitious. I don't have a desire to learn Python, java, and SQL,
on top of acquiring years of machine learning experience and finishing a degree in statistics. Personally, I want to focus on using
R and SAS to do statistical inference with smaller amounts of data. Maybe it's lazy and/or cynical of me, but I don't want to help Netflix
and Facebook get richer, and those careers also make me question job stability.
