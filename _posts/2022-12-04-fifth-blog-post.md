Now that I've nearly completed this course, I can think of two things that will stick with me: how I start a 
project and making use of R Markdown/github. Starting a project can be a daunting task and it's something
I've dreaded in previous classes (ST 502 and 518) as well as the first project or two in this class. I 
admittedly thought doing an EDA was a waste of time and disliked having to do it as a project requirement
for the first project; I've since realized how wrong I was. Similar to an outline for a big paper, it sets
everything up and gives the project a sense of direction that might take much longer to figure out otherwise.
In some ways, looking at the data tells the user exactly what needs to happen next because things stick out
like sore thumbs. That said, I will always start with an EDA for any future dataset I'm given.  

The second point kind of blends with the idea of how to approach a project, but using R Markdown in conjunction
with a narrative and pushing things to github helps organize the project, add efficiency, and give a professional
appearance. I was amazed the first time we created pdf and html documents with R Markdown how little effort was 
required to create documents that looked like a lot more time was put into them.  

Without any real job experience, it's difficult to say exactly what I want to do. I know that I enjoy performing
hypothesis tests or creating models in R and analyzing R^2 to see how well it explains the data. I will likely
choose to look into government jobs because I believe my time in active duty carries over toward the retirement
plan. I also know nothing about Python and would like to learn more. I know it's used a lot of big data; 
I also have an impression that it closely resembles R, so I'm hoping it won't be too painful a transition.
Finally, I would like to get more experience with fitting all kinds of models in R, SAS, and/or Python. I don't 
feel like I have a good understanding of when or why to try fitting a quadratic term or higher. Most of my
understanding has been to try what the professor taught and check the results. Does fitting a higher order term
have something to do with residual plots not fitting well? For example, if the residual vs. quantile plot shows
an "S" shape, would we want to try fitting a cubic term?  

Thanks for a very informative semester, Dr. Post! I'll see you in ST 590 next semester!
